# flight_seats_reservation
This is a simplified version of a website to manage places reservations on an airplane. For simplicity, the reservations are for a single aircraft and a single trip.

The text and comments might be in Italian language.

## What you can find here?
* On the home page you can view the **map of the places** showing the places purchased (red), free (green) or those booked by any user (orange). You can view the total number of places, the total number of those purchased, of those booked, and of those free.
* The reservation operation of the selected seats is only possible by registering or authentication on the website. So, you can find an **example of user registration** by a valid email, and a password that must contain at least one tiny alphabetical character and at least another character that is Alphabetical uppercase or a numeric character. Otherwise the registration is forbidden and the user receive an alert. This shows also how to **handle multiple users**.
* Without recharging the page, the server must be queried to verify that the place was not purchased in the meantime by another user, then you'll find an **Ajax call example**.
* **cookies settings**.
* Basic **javascript functions** usage.
* Creation of **database tables in SQL** and connection to the web server.
